* Performance improvements
  * A list is now created once with the data, what slots and pages are available. Previously, each new page was recalculated.
  * The pagination is now cached so that only 1x the slots and pages have to be calculated. The cache is released when closing the inventory.
* You can now specify a delay for the following methods:
  * InventoryContents#update
  * InventoryContents#updateOrSet
  * InventoryContents#updateTitle
* The custom events of RyseInventory can now be used in the builder in the #listener method.
* Fixed a bug in the De(serialization) method.
* RyseAnvil was removed and replaced with AnvilGUI.Builder.
* You can now set afterwards whether the player can close the inventory or not.
* Adventure is now shaded and is no longer needed as an extra dependency (you can still add the Adventure dependency).
